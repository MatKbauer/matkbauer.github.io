As a *cognitive scientist* by training, I learned to view and understand intelligence from different angles: From computer science, psychology, neuro science, linguistics, and philosophy. Towards the end of my undergrad studies, I *specialised in artificial intelligence*, learning a lot about *recurrent neural networks* to process and predict *time series data*, and conducted my master's thesis in the autonomous driving group at Daimler AG, where I investigated sources of temporal noise in object and car detector networks.

Subsequently I decided to pursue a *PhD in a socially and environmentally relevant topic: Weather Forecasting*. At the University of T端bingen, my supervisor, Prof. Dr. Martin Butz, and I delved into the beauty and challenges of atmospheric sciences, simultaneously with Google, NVIDIA and Microsoft, and *developed deep learning methods to improve global weather forecasts* in colaboration with Prof. Dr. Dale Durran at the University of Washington, among many others.

In March 2024, I obtained my PhD and continued as a PostDoc at the University of T端bingen with the Land-Atmospheric Feedback Initiative ([LAFI](https://www.lafi-dfg.de/), at the University of Hohenheim), which unifies an interdisciplinary consortium of excellent researchers to *better understand fine-scale processes that lead to convection, cloud formation, and precipitation*.

I am an enthusiastic *tinker and thinker*, I *love working on tough problems*, and enjoy developing my *professional coding skills*, my *personal mindset*, as well as my social *communication skills*.
